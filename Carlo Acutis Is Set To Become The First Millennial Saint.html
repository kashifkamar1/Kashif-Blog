      <article>
        <p>In October 2020, when Carlo Acutis was beatified in Assisi, Italy, the Catholic world celebrated a teenager whose brief life had already begun to inspire millions. Now, as he is set on the path to canonization, Carlo Acutis will become the first millennial saint—a remarkable milestone in the long history of the Catholic Church. His story is not only one of profound piety but also of modern relevance, bridging timeless faith with the reality of the digital age.</p>

        <h2>Early Life in Modern Times</h2>
        <p>Born on <strong>May 3, 1991</strong>, in London to Italian parents and raised in Milan, Carlo grew up with the same toys and hobbies as many young people of his generation: soccer, video games, films, and PlayStation. Yet from an early age Carlo showed an uncommon love for the Mass and the Eucharist—calling it his “highway to Heaven.” His devotion rekindled the faith of his moderately religious parents and became the foundation of his short but luminous life.</p>

        <h2>A Tech‑Savvy Apostle</h2>
        <p>Carlo saw the internet not only as entertainment but as a mission field. Combining his curiosity and coding skills, he created websites and online exhibits to catalog Eucharistic miracles from around the world. His digital exhibition, completed shortly before his death, has toured many countries and reached an even wider audience online. Carlo’s ability to harmonize cutting‑edge technology with traditional faith led to his reputation as "God’s influencer."</p>

        <blockquote>“People line up for rock stars or soccer matches, but the tabernacle—where God is—often remains empty.”</blockquote>

        <h2>An Ordinary Teenager with Extraordinary Love</h2>
        <p>Carlo remained approachable and joyful. Friends remember his humor, kindness, and readiness to defend bullied classmates. He volunteered for the poor, buying sleeping bags for homeless people with his pocket money. He loved Nutella, ice cream, animals, and computers—reminders that sanctity can be found in ordinary life.</p>

        <h2>The Sudden Illness</h2>
        <p>In 2006, at age 15, Carlo was diagnosed with an aggressive leukemia. Instead of succumbing to despair, he offered his suffering for the Pope and the Church, continuing to attend Mass as his strength allowed. Carlo died on <strong>October 12, 2006</strong>, in Monza, and was buried in Assisi. His grave has become a pilgrimage site for people worldwide.</p>

        <h2>The Path to Sainthood</h2>
        <p>The road to sainthood requires proof of heroic virtue and miracles attributed to a candidate’s intercession. Carlo’s beatification in 2020 followed recognition of a miracle: the inexplicable healing of a Brazilian boy with a rare pancreatic disorder after prayers to Carlo. A second recognized healing in 2023 advanced the cause toward canonization, setting Carlo to become the first millennial saint.</p>

        <h2>Significance for Today’s Youth</h2>
        <p>Carlo challenges the idea that the Church is out of touch with young people. His life shows that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology can be an instrument of evangelization rather than merely a distraction.</li>
          <li>Holiness often appears through small, consistent acts of charity and devotion.</li>
          <li>Courage in suffering can witness to deep trust in God.</li>
          <li>Saints can be relatable people who enjoy everyday life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Legacy in the Digital Age</h2>
        <p>Called by many an unofficial patron of the internet and computer programmers, Carlo’s digital exhibits continue to be shared globally. His beatification Mass in 2020 was live‑streamed worldwide — fitting for a young man who used the web to spread the Gospel. Schools and parishes often use his story to encourage youth to integrate faith with creativity and technology.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>Carlo Acutis’s canonization will be a symbolic moment in the Church’s engagement with modernity. As the first millennial saint, his life invites reflection: how can technology be sanctified and used to draw people to God? Carlo’s answer was simple — use what you love for what matters.</p>

        <p><em>Carlo Acutis, the teenager who played video games, loved ice cream, and coded websites, will stand as a reminder that ordinary lives—lived with extraordinary love—can point the world toward heaven.</em></p>

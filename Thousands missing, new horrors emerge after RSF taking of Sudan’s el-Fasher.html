  <h1>Thousands Missing, New Horrors Emerge After RSF Taking of Sudan’s El-Fasher</h1>

  <div class="summary">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> In late October 2025, Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured the city of El-Fasher in North Darfur. Since then, survivors and aid groups report that thousands are missing, with new evidence of mass killings, disappearances, and other grave human rights abuses. The situation has triggered international alarm and calls for urgent humanitarian access and independent investigations.

  <h2>What Happened in El-Fasher</h2>
  <img src="Thousands missing, new horrors emerge after RSF taking of Sudan’s el-Fasher.jpg" alt="Thousands missing, new horrors emerge after RSF taking of Sudan’s el-Fasher">
  <p>El-Fasher, a city in North Darfur, has long suffered from violence. In late October 2025, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a sudden and brutal assault on the city and nearby camps housing displaced people. The city had already been under siege for weeks before the RSF entered.</p>
  <p>Witnesses describe scenes of chaos: residents fleeing on foot or by car, others hiding in homes and mosques, and shelling that destroyed large areas. Videos show RSF fighters stopping people as they tried to escape. Men and boys were separated from women, beaten, humiliated, or even shot. Human Rights Watch and other organizations say they have verified footage showing extrajudicial killings and summary executions — killings carried out without trial.</p>

  <h2>Thousands Missing and Many Feared Dead</h2>
  <p>After the attack, entire neighborhoods were emptied. Families fled, leaving behind relatives whose fate is unknown. Aid groups and local leaders believe thousands are missing. Homes were burned, and bodies were seen on streets or buried in mass graves. Satellite images show disturbed earth and discoloration suggesting mass burial sites, adding to fears of widespread killings.</p>
  <p>Experts say satellite imagery helps identify possible grave locations, but only on-the-ground investigations can confirm the truth. The lack of access makes it difficult to determine how many people have died or disappeared.</p>

  <h2>Testimony from Survivors</h2>
  <img src="Thousands missing, new horrors emerge after RSF taking of Sudan’s el-Fasher2.jpg" alt="Thousands missing, new horrors emerge after RSF taking of Sudan’s el-Fasher2">
  <p>Those who escaped tell stories of extreme violence. Survivors describe being hunted by armed men, seeing neighbors dragged away, and hearing gunfire as they fled. Some report that hospitals were attacked and medical staff abducted or killed. Many women and children reached displacement camps terrified and exhausted, carrying nothing and leaving loved ones behind.</p>
  <p>A former soldier described the RSF attack as showing “no mercy,” saying troops shot people even when they were unarmed. Many survivors refuse to return because they fear further violence or revenge.</p>

  <h2>Evidence from Human Rights Groups and the UN</h2>
  <p>Human Rights Watch, the United Nations human rights office, and other organizations have reported horrifying allegations of executions, sexual violence, and forced disappearances. The UN warned that what is happening in El-Fasher may amount to serious violations of international law.</p>
  <p>These groups are demanding independent, international investigations with full access to sites and witnesses. The International Criminal Court (ICC), which has previously investigated crimes in Darfur, is being urged to act swiftly to preserve evidence and ensure accountability.</p>

  <h2>Displaced People and the Humanitarian Crisis</h2>
  <p>The fall of El-Fasher has triggered a new wave of displacement. Thousands have fled to nearby towns and camps with almost nothing. Aid organizations report severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medicine. Hospitals have been destroyed or overwhelmed, and diseases are spreading fast.</p>
  <p>Without safe access, humanitarian aid cannot reach those still trapped near the city. Aid workers themselves have been targeted in past attacks, making it even harder to deliver life-saving assistance. The UN warns that Sudan faces a worsening humanitarian disaster if help does not arrive soon.</p>

  <h2>Why Darfur Is So Dangerous</h2>
  <p>Darfur has a long and painful history of conflict and ethnic violence. In the early 2000s, fighting there killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. The RSF has roots in militias that carried out many of those earlier attacks. Analysts fear that history is repeating itself — with similar patterns of scorched villages, targeted killings, and mass graves emerging again.</p>

  <h2>International and Regional Response</h2>
  <p>World leaders and human rights groups have condemned the reports from El-Fasher. Some governments are calling for sanctions, arms embargoes, and diplomatic pressure on armed groups. Others demand safe corridors for civilians and immediate humanitarian access.</p>
  <p>Regional powers and African organizations are under growing pressure to act. Civilians’ safety now depends partly on whether neighboring countries and international actors will hold fighters accountable or continue to tolerate abuses. Experts say that without real action, statements alone will not protect lives.</p>

  <h2>The Need for Independent Investigations</h2>
  <p>Human rights groups and the UN insist that independent, transparent investigations are essential. Investigators need to reach sites, witnesses, hospitals, and suspected mass graves safely. Families deserve answers about missing relatives, and victims deserve justice.</p>
  <p>Proper investigations must collect names, testimonies, and forensic evidence in ways that meet international legal standards. Protecting survivors from retaliation is also vital. Only by uncovering the truth and prosecuting those responsible can future violence be prevented.</p>

  <h2>What People Need Now</h2>
  <p>Those who fled El-Fasher urgently need food, shelter, clean water, and medical care. Aid agencies require safe routes and funding to deliver help. Those still trapped need guarantees of safety and freedom to leave without being attacked. The international community can help create these safe conditions through coordinated diplomacy and pressure.</p>
  <p>Beyond emergency aid, Sudan needs a long-term plan for peace and justice — one that disarms militias, supports reconciliation, and rebuilds trust among communities. Without these steps, Darfur risks falling into another long cycle of tragedy.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The fall of El-Fasher to the RSF has brought new horror to a region that has already endured immense suffering. Thousands remain missing, and evidence points to mass killings and serious human rights abuses. Satellite data, survivor testimony, and UN reports paint a grim picture of what may be one of Darfur’s darkest chapters yet.</p>
  <p>The world must act — with urgent aid, credible investigations, and real accountability — to protect civilians and stop further atrocities. Without justice and protection, the people of Darfur face yet another generation of loss and despair.</p>

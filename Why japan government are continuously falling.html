        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Japan, often celebrated for its stable political system and status as the world’s third‑largest economy, has nonetheless experienced repeated government instability in recent years. Short‑lived administrations, coalition fragility, and rising voter dissatisfaction have combined to produce a pattern of frequent leadership change. This article probes the drivers behind why Japan’s governments keep falling, focusing on history, party dynamics, economic stressors, leadership culture, and external pressures.</p>

      <section id="history">
        <h2>Historical Context and Political Structure</h2>
        <p>Japan operates as a parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been the dominant force since 1955, creating a long tradition of single‑party dominance that masked internal factional battles and clientelist ties.</p>
        <p>Post‑war reforms entrenched civilian rule, but modern challenges have altered voter expectations and weakened long‑standing political bargains. Factionalism within the LDP, bureaucratic influence, and dependence on interest groups shaped governance for decades—factors that now interact with contemporary social and economic strains to magnify instability.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="electoral">
        <h2>Electoral Setbacks and Party Fragmentation</h2>
        <p>Recent election cycles have chipped away at the LDP‑Komeito coalition’s parliamentary dominance. In the 2025 elections the coalition lost its majority in the Upper House for the first time since the LDP’s post‑war rise, creating legislative gridlock and a constrained policy agenda.</p>
        <p>A resurgence of smaller opposition and populist parties—promising tax relief, social spending, and anti‑establishment reforms—has siphoned off disaffected voters. The LDP’s hesitation to embrace popular fiscal measures, such as consumption tax reductions, further eroded support and precipitated leadership challenges.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="economy">
        <h2>Economic Pressures and Public Discontent</h2>
        <p>Japan’s prolonged economic stagnation since the 1990s—often called the “Lost Decades”—continues to shape political sentiment. In 2025, inflationary pressures, wage stagnation, and rising living costs have intensified public frustration. Basic goods price increases and concerns over real incomes weigh heavily on voters’ evaluations of government competence.</p>
        <p>Fiscal constraints complicate policy choices. The government’s reliance on consumption taxes to finance social security makes tax cuts politically and economically difficult, while opposition promises of relief attract voters, increasing political volatility.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="leadership">
        <h2>Leadership Challenges and Political Culture</h2>
        <p>Short tenures for prime ministers and frequent resignations have become a hallmark of contemporary Japanese politics. Leaders often step down after electoral setbacks, scandals, or intra‑party disputes, preventing sustained policy agendas from taking root.</p>
        <p>Japan’s political culture—marked by consensus‑oriented decision making, strong factionalism within parties, and bureaucratic continuity—can inhibit bold reform. The resulting leadership fragility leaves new prime ministers scrambling to build coalitions and enact measures before their authority wanes.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="external">
        <h2>External and Geopolitical Factors</h2>
        <p>External pressures shape domestic politics. Trade tensions, particularly with the United States over tariffs and economic policy, affect Japan’s economic choices and complicate consensus building. Regional security threats—from North Korean missile tests to China’s military assertiveness—require coherent foreign and defense policy, but fragmentation at home undermines such coherence.</p>
        <p>Global market shocks and supply‑chain disruptions further constrain policymaking in a fragmented political environment, where decisive action is harder to implement.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Japan’s recurring government collapses are the product of interlocking causes: eroded parliamentary majorities, economic stagnation and cost‑of‑living pressures, short‑lived leadership, intra‑party factionalism, and geopolitically driven policy complexity. While Japan retains strong democratic institutions and remains economically influential, addressing this pattern of instability requires institutional reforms, renewed policy clarity, and leaders capable of forging durable consensus in an evolving political landscape.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In short, frequent Japanese government failures in 2025 are driven by electoral setbacks for the LDP‑Komeito coalition, economic hardship fueling voter discontent, leadership churn, factional party culture, and external geopolitical pressures—factors that together produce a fragile political environment despite Japan’s deep institutional foundations.</p>

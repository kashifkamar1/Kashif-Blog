        <h2>Background and Context</h2>
        <p>Prince Harry’s commitment to supporting wounded military personnel is long‑standing and personal. A nearly decade‑long British Army veteran and the founder of the Invictus Games (2014), Harry has consistently championed recovery through adaptive sport and rehabilitation. Ukrainian veterans have been involved with the Invictus movement since 2017, and participation increased following Russia’s full‑scale invasion.</p>
        <p>This September visit followed an earlier trip to Lviv in April 2025, where he visited the Superhumans Tra Center—an organisation providing prosthetics and psychological support. The Ukrainian government extended a formal invitation for the September engagement, reflecting the importance Kyiv places on international rehabilitation partnerships.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="visit">
        <h2>The Visit and Its Activities</h2>
        <p>Arriving in Kyiv by overnight train with a team from the Invictus Games Foundation, Prince Harry kept a low public profile for security reasons while meeting injured servicemen, rehabilitation professionals, and government figures. Ukrainian Railways shared footage of his arrival; from there he visited several rehabilitation centres and met with around 200 veterans.</p>
        <div class="grid cols-2">
          <div>
            <h3>Engagements</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Visits to rehabilitation and prosthetic centres.</li>
              <li>Meetings with veterans and families to discuss rehabilitation needs.</li>
              <li>Dialogues with government officials, including a reported meeting with Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Highlight rehabilitation and reintegration beyond frontline support.</li>
              <li>Present expanded Invictus Games Foundation initiatives focused on medical, psychological, and community‑based programmes.</li>
              <li>Mobilise global attention and funding for long‑term recovery projects.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Harry emphasised the limits of influence over the geopolitics of war while stressing the practical difference rehabilitation and solidarity can make: “We cannot stop the war, but we can do everything within our power to support the healing journey.”</p>
      </section>

      <section id="charitable">
        <img src="uk prince.jpg" alt="uk prince">
        <h2>Charitable and Global Impact</h2>
        <p>The visit aligns with broader humanitarian efforts through Harry and Meghan Markle’s Archewell Foundation and the Invictus Games Foundation. Recent grants included support for injured children and medical evacuations in conflict zones, as well as contributions to prosthetics development and psychological care coordinated with international agencies.</p>
        <p>Beyond finances, the visit raises visibility for practical rehabilitation needs—training for medical staff, supply chains for prosthetic care, and community reintegration programs that are essential for long‑term recovery.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="significance">
        <h2>Significance and Symbolism</h2>
        <p>Prince Harry’s visit carried multiple layers of symbolism. It reaffirmed international solidarity with Ukraine during a protracted conflict, underlined the importance of rehabilitation in post‑conflict recovery, and humanised the impact of war through direct engagement with veterans.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the visit came amid renewed public attention to Harry’s charitable work and followed a rare meeting with King Charles III in London—events that together shaped public conversation about royal family dynamics and the wider role of royal influence in humanitarian causes.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Prince Harry’s surprise September 2025 visit to Kyiv represented a tangible gesture of support for wounded Ukrainian servicemen and highlighted the crucial role of rehabilitation in the wider humanitarian response to conflict. By leveraging the Invictus Games Foundation and allied charitable efforts, the visit both mobilised resources and renewed global attention for the long‑term needs of those recovering from war.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Arriving discreetly by train, Prince Harry met hundreds of Ukrainian veterans and rehabilitation professionals, presented expanded Invictus Games Foundation initiatives, and amplified the global focus on recovery and reintegration. The trip underscored the importance of rehabilitation as an integral part of post‑conflict resilience and demonstrated continued international solidarity with Ukraine.</p>

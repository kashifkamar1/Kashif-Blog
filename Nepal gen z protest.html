        <h2>Rise of Gen‑Z Activism: The Call for Change</h2>
        <p>The protests that erupted across Nepal in September 2025 were marked by a distinctive composition and focus: young Nepalis—predominantly Gen‑Z—mobilized independently to demand an end to systemic corruption and governmental overreach. Eschewing traditional party structures, these demonstrators organized through digital platforms such as Discord and TikTok while sustaining powerful street actions.</p>
        <p>Unlike prior movements often led or co‑opted by political parties, Gen‑Z insisted on independent youth leadership, coordinating through decentralized networks and viral campaigns that held political elites to account.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ban">
        <h2>Social Media Ban as the Tipping Point</h2>
        <p>On September 4, 2025, the government ordered the blocking of 26 major social media platforms, including Facebook and YouTube—citing reasons such as combating misinformation and hate speech. For many young Nepalis, the ban was perceived as a draconian attempt to silence dissent and disrupt livelihoods that increasingly depend on digital platforms.</p>
        <p>The ban struck at the core of Gen‑Z communication and organisation, triggering mass demonstrations across Kathmandu and major provincial cities. Protesters rallied with slogans such as “Shut down corruption, not social media” and rapidly amplified the movement through alternative online channels and offline networks.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="roots">
        <h2>Roots of Frustration: Nepotism, Economic Strain, and Lost Opportunities</h2>
        <p>While the social media ban acted as the immediate catalyst, deeper grievances had long been building: chronic unemployment, limited economic opportunities, and a pervasive sense of nepotism and elite capture. In a country where remittances form a large share of GDP and average incomes are low, the ostentatious lifestyles of political families—highlighted by viral posts—fanned public outrage.</p>
        <p>Gen‑Z leveraged digital tools to document and expose perceived abuses, coordinating protests, communicating safety measures, and calling for systemic change, including indefinite college closures until accountability measures were implemented.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="escalation">
        <h2>Escalation: Violence, Curfews, and Nationwide Unrest</h2>
        <p>The protests escalated rapidly. Attempts to storm parliament on September 8–9 led to forceful responses from security forces—tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition were reported. Curfews were imposed in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Pokhara and other cities, yet demonstrations continued to spread nationwide.</p>
        <p>Significant public buildings and residences of political figures were attacked and set on fire. Reports from the initial days indicated at least 19 civilian deaths and numerous injuries, prompting national and international calls for restraint and independent investigations.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="collapse">
        <h2>Political Collapse: PM Oli’s Resignation and Leadership Vacuum</h2>
        <p>Facing mounting unrest and loss of control, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and several ministers resigned on September 9. Their departure created a leadership void; administrative functions were disrupted and the Nepal Army assumed an increased role to restore order while initiating talks with protest representatives.</p>
        <p>Protesters and civic coalitions began online consultations to envision an interim governing arrangement centered on transparency, anti‑corruption measures, and a timetable for fresh elections.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="sushila">
        <h2>Sushila Karki: Gen‑Z’s Choice for Interim Prime Minister</h2>
        <p>Emerging from youth consultations, former Chief Justice Sushila Karki became the leading candidate for interim prime minister. Renowned for her anti‑corruption stance and non‑partisan record, Karki was endorsed by many youth organizers following online voting and dialogue with the army.</p>
        <p>Her proposed mandate prioritizes constitutional safeguards, the establishment of a “Cleanliness Committee” to investigate corruption, and a pledge to hold general elections within six months—an approach that seeks to translate protest energy into institutional reform.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="reactions">
        <h2>Reactions and Consequences: National and International Response</h2>
        <p>The unrest prompted sharp national reflection and an outcry from human rights groups. Amnesty International and the UN called for independent probes into the deaths and injuries, and urged authorities to respect civil liberties. Regional neighbours raised concerns about border security and disrupted flights to Kathmandu affected regional travel and trade.</p>
        <p>The crisis also invigorated debates on digital rights, governance reform, and the role of youth in political decision‑making—discussion that now sits at the center of Nepal’s political agenda.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="future">
        <h2>Can Youth Power Build a New Nepal?</h2>
        <p>The Gen‑Z movement marks a profound challenge to established politics in Nepal. While the protests have catalyzed political change, the path to durable reform will hinge on institutional follow‑through, credible investigations, and the ability of interim leaders to hold elections that reflect a renewed social contract.</p>
        <p>Whether Sushila Karki—and a coalition of youth, civil society, and reform‑minded officials—can convert momentary momentum into lasting structural change remains the pivotal question for Nepal’s democratic future.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Gen‑Z protests in Nepal were triggered by systemic corruption and a sweeping social media ban, evolving into nationwide demonstrations that led to the resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli. With Sushila Karki emerging as the preferred interim leader, Nepal stands at a crossroads—its future dependent on whether youth‑led demands for transparency, accountability, and digital rights can be institutionalized.</p>
